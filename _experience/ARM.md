I was set the task of creating a tool in Python to sort through multiple databases. After 2 weeks of development the program worked and could be used to sort through the databases and identify contradictions and omissions . I presented my work to an audience of about 20 at the end of my work experience. In a letter to my school, my supervisor said I was “confident, self-motivated and independent”.
