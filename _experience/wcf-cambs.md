I volunteered with Cambridge Woodcraft Folk by helping with and organising sessions for Elfins (6 to 9 year olds) and Pioneers (10 to 12 year olds). The Woodcraft Folk is an organisation that focuses on empowering young people through education and social awareness. Sessions ranged from Fun Maths to Refugees and Homelessness to even night time walks and bushcraft.
