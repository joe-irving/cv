<section>
  
      <h2><strong>ARM</strong> / Work Experience</h2>
      <p><em><time>June 2016</time> - <time>June 2016</time> Cambridge</em></p>
      <p>I was set the task of creating a tool in Python to sort through multiple databases. After 2 weeks of development the program worked and could be used to sort through the databases and identify contradictions and omissions . I presented my work to an audience of about 20 at the end of my work experience. In a letter to my school, my supervisor said I was “confident, self-motivated and independent”.</p>

  
      <h2><strong>A Level Peer Tutoring</strong> / Chemistry</h2>
      <p><em><time>December 2018</time> - <time>May 2019</time> Cambridge</em></p>
      <p>During year 13, I tutored a year 12 student  in Chemistry.</p>

  
      <h2><strong>Espresso Library</strong> / Kitchen Porter</h2>
      <p><em><time>May 2017</time> - <time>March 2018</time> Cambridge</em></p>
      <p>I worked at the Café as a part time job, and learned how to work efficiently by organising myself.</p>

  
      <h2><strong>KS3/4 Tutoring</strong> / Maths</h2>
      <p><em><time>December 2018</time> - <time>May 2019</time> Cambridge</em></p>
      <p>I gave one-to-one Mathematics tutoring to a Year 9 student who was struggling and wanted to move up a set.</p>

  
      <h2><strong>Woodcraft Folk</strong> / Volunteer</h2>
      <p><em><time>September 2015</time> - <time>July 2019</time> Cambridge</em></p>
      <p>I volunteered with Cambridge Woodcraft Folk by helping with and organising sessions for Elfins (6 to 9 year olds) and Pioneers (10 to 12 year olds). The Woodcraft Folk is an organisation that focuses on empowering young people through education and social awareness. Sessions ranged from Fun Maths to Refugees and Homelessness to even night time walks and bushcraft.</p>

<h1 id="interests">Interests</h1>

<p>I am involved with the national <a href="https://woodcraft.org.uk/">Woodcraft Folk</a> DFs Movement, and I finished  my first year on DF Committee as Accessibility Representative in October 2018  and I am currently  Secretary and  Web Fairy (the person who maintains our website: <a href="http://spanthat.world">spanthat.world</a>).
