# Interests

I am involved with the national [Woodcraft Folk](https://woodcraft.org.uk/) DFs Movement, and I finished  my first year on DF Committee as Accessibility Representative in October 2018  and I am currently  Secretary and  Web Fairy (the person who maintains our website: [spanthat.world](http://spanthat.world)). Through these roles I must successfully organise and communicate with people in and outside our movement, as well as coordinating events of up to 100 people.

I actively campaign for climate justice, and find myself bouncing between campaingns
like [Axe Drax](axedrax.ga) and my local Extinction Rebellion's group.
